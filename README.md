#Student Management System using ArrayList
#Student Management project by adding:
1.
An interface → to define student operations.
2.
Custom exception handling → for cases like student not found or duplicate ID.
Key Improvements:
Interface (StudentOperations) defines all CRUD methods.
Custom Exceptions:
DuplicateStudentException → prevents adding same ID twice.
StudentNotFoundException → handles missing student cases.
Exception Handling in Main → program won’t crash, shows friendly messages.
